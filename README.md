# Michael Small - Lead Frontend Developer at Relationship One - Angular Fan

- Full-time Angular job + Part-time Angular Hobbyist
- I like to improve my skills and give advice to others
- Contrary to my friend/coworker's take, I am not going to "marry Angular".
- Big on forms (mostly reactive forms, learning to appreciate template driven forms) and also on reactivity with RXJS + Signals
- Trying to get better with accessibility and testing (which go well together)
- I use semantic commits messages except for this bio, pinky promise
